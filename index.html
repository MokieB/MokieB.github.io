	Life isn’t always what you see in the movies, though the people you meet feel straight out of one. My mother is one of those people. She’s a trooper, and fought through every single thing regardless of the predicted outcome. She’s inspirational, and she is my pushing drive to succeed and prevail through whatever curveball life decides to throw my way. <br>

                Since I was young, she was always very over-protective. She would go out of her way to skip meals to make sure her children ate first, and with money being a big problem, she’d find out ways to make ends meet by the end of the month. In total, she had 6 kids in the span of 8 years, and she raised them all to fight hard and play this so-called-game of life efficiently and vigorously. With our upsides, came our downsides, as well. We lived in a bit of a rough situation at home. By 8, I was cooking and cleaning as if I owned the home alongside my mother. My father never really supported my family, only providing the bare minimum, as he used the rest of the money on himself. He was verbally abusive for the most part, but there were times when it went out of hand. When I turned 14, we finally left the situation we were in with no money and hopes of a new life. 
              <br>
                Moving in and out of hotels taught me the meaning of living day by day. We didn’t know where we were going to be next week, so we didn’t take the time to really learn our surroundings. By nearly 80 days, we realized the government wasn’t working to help us, but rather they had been working against us. My mother pushed and took on 2 jobs to support her family and purchase a small town-apartment. After such an achievement, however, life had yet another curveball to throw. The same trooper that I had seen taking on her own battles day after day, defeated as her car was repossessed from my father failing to pay for it. Child support rode flat, and rarely did he ever actually send anything. The same woman had finally looked like she had given up, but still smiled and gave hope to her children that she knew had a future. She wouldn’t give up.
              <br>
                As times adjusted, she found more suitable jobs that paid better and felt more her style. The children she raised went on to do better in school, and meet new people and actually experience a life worth living. She finally picked the pace that was needed, and even started school herself to learn psychiatry. After all, she was finally able to be herself without being controlled by someone else.  She and her children finally felt at peace. Expression and giving felt right for once, and it no longer seemed like there was nobody to reach out to. 
              <br>
                I was one of those children. I finally got to be myself, and I worked on bettering myself and holding my past as a learning experience to try harder. Standing alongside my mother, I experienced just how strong she really was facing a world almost entirely against her, and I wouldn’t trade those memories for anything better. I strive to be the same trooper I saw in my mother one day.
